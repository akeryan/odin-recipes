<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my grandma's best lasagna recipe, except I use sour cream instead of ricotta (a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law). She always made it for birthdays and special occasions. This makes a large amount, so I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy, so sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ pound ground pork sausage</li>
    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease.</li>
    <li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Stir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella, Parmesan, olives, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
